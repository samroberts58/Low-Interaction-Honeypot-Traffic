				<h3>Recommendations for Future Research</h3>
                <p>One way to elaborate on the project's goal would be to include additional data points. Location elements scored highly with the Random Forest Classifier's feature importances function.  It could be beneficial to incorporate publicly-available information, like country holidays or significant political events, as a way to identify a relationship with broader social and cultural influences and attack parameters.
                <br/><br/> 
                Another recommendation would be to improve upon the Multinomial Naive Bayes's success by creating a more in-depth recurring neural network.  This data set's features were well-aligned to classification, and a neural network implementation could incorporate the implicit relationships between variables, which is counter to Naive Bayes' foundation. 
                <br/><br/> 
                Lastly, it would be beneficial to replicate this project with another independent data set to verify the results are applicable to a greater population. 
                </p>
                <br/><br/>
                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
				<p> This project attempted to utilize data gathered from a network of low-interaction honeypots to explore the predictability of incoming, hostile network traffic to various destination ports. The high accuracy rate of the resulting Multinomial Naive Bayes model supports the ability to refine company cybersecurity strategies based on information from an economical honeypot solution. This information could be applied to create dynamic firewall rules as a preventative measure to protecting company assets.
