Exploratory Data Analysis & Modeling		**Reference Files: EDA_Modeling.py, ChiSquareInd_results.txt
*Note: Utilizing Python 3.6 Spyder with Python Interpreter pointed to Intel Distribution for Python (IDP) -- not required

1) Use EDA_Modeling.py
	Connect SSMS database to Python for direct data pull and analysis.
	**Update server and database variables to match user's local configuration. Lines 29, 30!

2) All variables are categorical so statistical methods include:
	- Chi Square Test (Goodness of Fit)
	- Chi Square Test of Independence
	- Poisson Distributions	(Cumulative Distribution Function)
	- Covariance Matrix (Located in Modeling section)

	Preliminary Python Visualizations include:
	- Bar charts (Frequency Tables)
	- Scatterplots (variables compared with 'ts' (for timeline) and 'dst_port')
	- Catplots (Categorical Plots - with seaborn library, hue can be third var)
	- Heatmaps (covariance matrix)
	- Cumulative Frequency Chart (Poisson Distribution)

	Refined Visualizations are in the Tableau workbook (DATS6501-Capstone):
	*Requires a Tableau Online account
	- indexWorldMap
	- Basic Chart Dashboard
	- Scatterplot Dashboard
	- Interaction Dashboard
	- ChiSqrInd


3) Model Assumptions:
	- Classification Models
	- Statistically significant interactions listed in ChiSquareInd_results.txt.
	- 5 Independent Variables:
		- src_ip
		- eventid
		- sensor
		- Country
		- City
	- 1 Dependent Variable:
		- dst_port

4) Model Process
	- Create X, y from the data set
	- One hot encode for X, LabelEncoder for y
	- Random Forest Classifier
	- Hyperparameter Tuning
		-Take small sample (n = 100)
		-Train, Test on 3 models (Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Multinomial Naive Bayes)
	- Best Performance Model: Multinomial Naive Bayes

	Model Visualizations:
	- Random Forest Classifer tree
