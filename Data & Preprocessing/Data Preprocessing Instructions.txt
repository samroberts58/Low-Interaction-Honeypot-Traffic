Original Data Set & JSON files 		**Reference Files: Heisenberg_toCSV.py
1) Download data from Rapid7's website (https://opendata.rapid7.com/heisenberg.cowrie/)
2) Unzip the file of JSON's to current working directory.
3) Run 'Heisenberg_toCSV.py' to pull each file by name and rewrite to CSV.  
	Ensure current working directory in Python is set to folder with the unzipped JSONs.


CSV's					** Reference Files: 10 .CSV's in current working directory
4) Move the CSVs to a new folder named 'CSVs'.
5) All unique Source IP addresses were identified by creating each separate src_ip file.  
	The list of unique src_ip values was copied and ran through an IP lookup website (https://ip2geo.org/). 
	IP geography data (Country, City) was pulled in batches of 10,000, and the data was saved in a master file called 'src_ip_lookup.csv'. 
		*Individual src_ip files (src_ip_1_0_0.csv, src_ip_1_1_0.csv, etc.) were deleted after unique src_ip addresses
		had been copied into the main file (src_ip_lookup.csv).
5) Do VLOOKUP operations to copy source IP information in each of the CSV files ('CSV_1_0_0', 'CSV_1_1_0', etc.).
6) Change the data type of 'ts' to long date format in each file to represent date and hour elements.
7) Remove any nulls for ts, src_ip, session, eventid, sensor, Country, or City.
8) Reorder columns of each CSV file to the following sequence: src_port, dst_port, ts, src_ip, session, duration, eventid, sensor, Country, City
	*Delete Username and Password features at this time due to hidden characters, which causes an import error for SQL Server.


SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)	**Reference Files: CreateFinaltbl.sql, DataPreprocessing.sql
9) Create a database named "Heisenberg_Honeypot".
10) Import each CSV into SSMS. 
11) Combine all tables into one master table for analysis. (CreateFinaltbl.sql)
12) Review each variable separately, noting blanks, N/A's, and other erroneous entries.
13) Drop src_port and duration columns (Right click on column, delete from Object Explorer)
14) Remove blanks, #N/A, 0 from dst_port, eventid, and Country columns.
15) Rename City blanks, #N/A's, and '0' to 'N/A'.
16) Delete all Netherland entries from Country column.
